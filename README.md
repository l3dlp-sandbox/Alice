# Alice

Say 'Hi' to Alice üëã

Alice is an open-source AI assistant that offers voice interaction, text-to-speech, and image recognition. It leverages powerful language and vision APIs to facilitate natural conversations, perform helpful tasks, and respond to visual inputs with deep context-aware intelligence.

The goal of this project is to create a personal AI assistant that is pleasant to use and interact with. Not a soulless chatbot, but as much "real" AI companion as possible.

## Features

- üó£Ô∏è **Voice recognition**  
  Speak to Alice using voice with fast Voice Activity Detection (VAD), transcribed via OpenAI's gpt-4o-transcribe or Groq's whisper-large-v3 API.

- üí¨ **Text-to-speech**  
  Alice responds with natural-sounding speech using OpenAI's TTS API.

- üñºÔ∏è **Image recognition & Image generation**  
  Capture screenshots and let Alice interpret them using OpenAI's Vision API. Generate images using OpenAI gpt-image-1.

- üìù **Memory system**  
  All Alice interactions are stored in a local database, allowing her to remember past conversations and facts.  
  - **Thoughts:** Past conversation fragments embedded in a local Hnswlib vector database for quick context inspiration.  
  - **Memories:** Long-term structured facts stored in a local database, retrievable on demand via memory tools.  
  - **Summarization:** Past messages are automatically summarized and served to Alice for longer context awareness.
  - **User emotion awareness:** Summarization includes a user emotion summary, enabling more empathetic replies.

- üéûÔ∏è **Animated assistant appearance**  
  Several video states (standby, thinking, speaking) are used to make interactions lively.

- ü™™ **Advanced system prompt**  
  Alice comes with an advanced system prompt that allows a seamless user experience and tool usage. The system prompt can be updated in settings at any time.
