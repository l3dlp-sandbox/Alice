# Alice

Say 'Hi' to Alice ðŸ‘‹

Alice is a Vue.js/Vite/Electron.js application (OpenAI/Groq/Pinecone wrapper) that provides an interactive AI assistant with voice recognition, text-to-speech, and image recognition capabilities. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini language model and various APIs for natural language processing, speech recognition, function calling, and vision tasks.

## Features

- **Voice recognition:** Speak to Alice using voice with Voice Activity Detection (VAD), transcribed via Groq's Whisper API.
- **Text-to-speech:** Alice responds with natural-sounding speech using OpenAI's TTS API.
- **Image recognition:** Capture screenshots and let Alice interpret them using OpenAI's Vision API.
- **Memory system:**  
  - **Thoughts:** Past conversation fragments embedded in a Pinecone vector database for quick context inspiration.  
  - **Memories:** Long-term structured facts stored in a Supabase database, retrievable on demand via memory tools.
- **Animated assistant appearance:** Several video states (standby, thinking, speaking) to make interactions lively.
- **Function calling:**  
  Data retrieval:
   - Web search
   - Website content extraction
   - Torrent search
   - Weather checking
   - Current date and time awareness
