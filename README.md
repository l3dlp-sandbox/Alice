# Alice

Say 'Hi' to Alice ðŸ‘‹

Alice App is a Vue.js/Electron.js application (OpenAI/Groq/Pinecone wrapper) that provides an interactive AI assistant with voice recognition, text-to-speech, and image recognition capabilities. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o language model and various APIs for natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision tasks.
This project was created and maintained for personal use and shared with the community.

## Features

- **Voice recognition:** Users can speak to the AI assistant, and their speech is transcribed into text using Groq's Whisper API.
- **Text-to-speech:** The AI assistant can respond with synthesized speech using OpenAI's TTS API.
- **Image recognition:** Users can take screenshots, and the AI assistant can recognize the contents of the image using OpenAI's Vision API.
- **Conversation history:** The application stores and retrieves relevant conversation history to provide context-aware responses.
- **Pinecone vector database:** Conversation messages are embedded and stored in a Pinecone vector database to retrieve relevant memories efficiently.
- **Animated assistant appearance:** Using prerendered AI-generated videos
- **Function calling:** The AI assistant can use web search, get weather forecasts and current date/time

## Technologies Used

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (JS framework)
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) (State Management)
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) (GPT-4o-mini, TTS, Vision)
- [Groq API](https://console.groq.com/) (Whisper)
- [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) (Vector Database)
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) (Desktop Application framework)
- [ChatGPT 4o](https://chat.com) (Native image generation)
- [Kling 1.6 pro (fal.ai)](https://fal.ai/) (Image-to-video)

## TODO
- add a settings menu
- add an option to choose vector DB provider/source
- add a real-time API option with the audio-to-audio interface and video(screen-sharing/camera) input
- add the ability to output images and other media content
- make Alice animations real-time with the lip sync
- something else ... depends on where the technology will be at the moment

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pmbstyle/Alice.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Setup an assistant on the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/assistants), add tools if needed
4. Set up environment variables with your OpenAI & Groq and Pinecone API keys.
5. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
6. Build the Electron app: `npm run build`
7. Install the app from the `release` folder
8. Enjoy =)
