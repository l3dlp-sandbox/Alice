# Alice

Say 'Hi' to Alice ðŸ‘‹

Alice App is a Vue.js/Electron.js application (OpenAI/Groq/Pinecone wrapper) that provides an interactive AI assistant with voice recognition, text-to-speech, and image recognition capabilities. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini language model and various APIs for natural language processing, speech recognition, function calling, and computer vision tasks.
This project was created and maintained for personal use and shared with the community.

## Features

- **Voice recognition:** Users can speak to Alice, and their speech is transcribed into text using Groq's Whisper API.
- **Text-to-speech:** Alice can respond with synthesized speech using OpenAI's TTS API.
- **Image recognition:** Users can take screenshots, and Alice can recognize the contents of the image using OpenAI's Vision API.
- **Conversation history:** The application stores and retrieves relevant conversation history to provide context-aware responses.
- **Pinecone vector database:** Conversation messages are embedded and stored in a Pinecone vector database to retrieve relevant memories efficiently.
- **Animated assistant appearance:** Using prerendered AI-generated videos
- **Function calling:** Alice can perform web searches, crawl/scrape web page content, open apps or URLs on the user's PC, and manage clipboard content.
